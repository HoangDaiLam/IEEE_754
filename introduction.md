📄 This repository has been created to support the study of IEEE 754 single-precision and double-precision formats. Its primary purpose is to facilitate understanding of their underlying mechanisms and to serve as a foundation for the accompanying mathematical report.
Some objects and functions in the attatched program have been made with the help of AI in order to stimulate how IEEE754 works to the finest!
